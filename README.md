# FizzJim-1000-Haskell
A fizzbuzz function, importing functions from other files, and unit tests in Haskell.

This is the source code for the repl.it project located here: https://repl.it/@JimLynch/FizzJim-1000-Haskell

_Note: I don't think you can actually import Test.Spec in repl.it project so you may need to delete the `.test.hs` file in order to successfully run it!_
